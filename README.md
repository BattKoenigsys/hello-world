Familiarisation Repository
I am refamliarising myself with GITHUB as a used to have an account once, but through lack of use, have forgotten how to use it. 
Anyhoo, the reason that I am releaning this is all part of getting ready to work as a full stack developer, so I need to make sure I keep everything up to date, as well as track changes, and collaborate with others.
